# Constraints
We define the following methods to provide a compositional approach toward defining common constraints used in coupled gas-power models.
These methods should always be defined over `AbstractGasPowerModel`.


```@autodocs
Modules = [GasPowerModels]
Pages   = ["core/constraint_template.jl"]
Order   = [:type, :function]
Private  = true
```
