# Constraints
We provide the following methods to provide a compositional approach for defining common variables used in coupled gas grid flow models.
These methods should always be defined over `AbstractGasModel` and/or `AbstractPowerModel`.


```@autodocs
Modules = [GasPowerModels]
Pages   = ["core/constraint_template.jl"]
Order   = [:type, :function]
Private  = true
